```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Basic Commands

```{r vector}
x <- c(1, 3, 2, 5)
x
```
```{r }


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
